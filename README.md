Mini Challenge 3 - Redo
In this challenge we ask the user their name, and the time they woke up, and the program will repeat their answers back to them in a greeting. As a personal choice, I did not make it necessary to enter a number, so the user may enter that they woke up at "6", "6:00", "six", "six o'clock", etc.
