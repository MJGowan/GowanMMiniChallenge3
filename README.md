Mini Challenge 3 - Redo
In this challenge we ask the user their name, and the time they woke up, and the program will repeat their answers back to them in a greeting. As a personal choice, I did not make it necessary to enter a number, so the user may enter that they woke up at "6", "6:00", "six", "six o'clock", etc.

Peer review by : Caroline Hana -The code runs good I only ran into one issue which can be such a simple fix. One of the if statements needs to be turned into a while statement, because everytime i input something incorrect it just ends instead of looping. Other then that the code ran and the other validations were correct.
